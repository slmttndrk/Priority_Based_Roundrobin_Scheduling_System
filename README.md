# Priority_Based_Roundrobin_Scheduling_System

In this program, I implemented a priority based roundrobin scheduling system for CPUs using the knowledge of Threads and Semaphores.

# Procedure

In the input file, there are

	- codeX.txt-> which mimics the X type of process' instructions and their durations,
	- definition.txt-> which differentiates the processes according to their priorities, type of used codeX intructions and their arrival times.

In the output file, the program generates the system time with the status of the process queue and the utilisation of the CPU.

# Execution

In order to run the program, you should have "gcc compiler" in your machine. And there is a "Makefile.sh" in the directory to execute the code.
